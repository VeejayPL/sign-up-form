# Sign up form

## Description

This project was created for the Sign up form assignment as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The below solution is based on layout given in assignment sprinkled with my own creativity.

### Project summary

The form:

- hints user what inputs are required,
- validates user input and displays either the green or red checkmark,
- has input fields with a "shake" effect for invalid data,
- has active labels instead of placeholders.
